## Aloha Homepage

I've replicated the designer's vision for the homepage of Aloha Apparel. The page includes a smooth scrolling navigation menu, a carousel of featured products with an 'add to cart' feature, a gallery of categories, and an email sign up form.

## Getting Started

Since its just one page, navigation is pretty straightforward! The navigation menu at the top will take you to where you want to go on the page. The add to cart button will update the cart counter icon at the top right corner of the page, and the sign up form just above the footer gives you the option to sign up for email updates.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery 3.2.1
* Flickity
* Font Awesome 



The mark up is HTML 5 styled with CSS3. I've imported jQuery 3.2.1 to facilitate some of the interactive elements such as the smooth scrolling feature, activating Flickity for the carousel, and updating the cart counter icon after the 'add to cart' button is pushed. I've included Flickity with a CDN for the products carousel. I've also included a CDN from Font Awesome for the social media icons in the footer.

I went to stack overflow for the smooth scrolling feature as well as the email verification Regular Expression.
